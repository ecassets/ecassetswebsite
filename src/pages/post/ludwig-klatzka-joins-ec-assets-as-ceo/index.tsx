              Ludwig&apos;s extensive experience in advising companies on
              digitalization and process automation will strengthen EC
              Assets&apos; established PE devision in executing cross-border M&A
              transactions. EC Assets has been expanding its PE devision since
              2015, and the addition of Ludwig to our talented team augments our
              abilities across the full spectrum of strategic M&A.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              One of our key strategic priorities is to expand significantly our
              presence in Europe and beyond with a focus across all tech
              sectors. Ludwig&apos;s arrival is another step toward that goal,
              and we expect to maintain that momentum and extend our reach.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              The expansion of our PE capability is a natural tie-in to the
              strength of our Real Estate business and our international deal
              capabilities, which are foundational pillars of our growth
              strategy. Ludwig is excited to join the team at a time when the
              private equity industry is set to continue breaking records on
              deal values and volume. Working thoroughly and forward-thinking,
              he is focused on delivering the right resources to best execute
              our transactions across all relevant markets.
